# Frontend Mentor - Designo agency website solution

This is a solution to the [Designo agency website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/designo-multipage-website-G48K6rfUT). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge:

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with:

- Angular 17
- Angular routing
- TypeScript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Scss
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Leaflet JS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bem (I am not 100% using it, it just offers some guidelines for me to follow)
- Webstorm

### What I learned:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css

```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

- I didn't use nav in the footer as W3C specification states:
  > Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element â€” the element
  > is primarily intended for sections that consist of major navigation blocks.
  > In particular, it is common for footers to have a short list of links to various
  > pages of a site, such as the terms of service, the home page, and a copyright page.
  > The footer element alone is sufficient for such cases; while a nav element can be
  > used in such cases, it is usually unnecessary.
